Need python / jupyter notebook installed.

Basic Concepts:

Angles: Measurement of angles in degrees and radians.
Coterminal Angles: Angles that share the same terminal side.
Reference Angles: The acute angle formed with the x-axis.

Trigonometric Functions:
Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), and Tangent (tan): Definition using right triangles and the unit circle.
Cosecant (csc), Secant (sec), and Cotangent (cot): These are the reciprocals of sin, cos, and tan, respectively.

Graphs of Trigonometric Functions:
Understanding the basic shapes, periods, amplitudes, and phase shifts of sin, cos, and tan functions.

Trigonometric Identities:
Reciprocal Identities: Relating sin, cos, and tan to their reciprocals.
Pythagorean Identities: sin^2 (theta) + cos^2 (theta) = 1
Co-Function Identities: sin(90 deg - theta) = cos(theta)
Double and Half-Angle Formulas:  sin(2 theta) = 2sin(theta)cos(theta)
Sum and Difference Formulas: sin(α+β)=sin(α)cos(β)+cos(α)sin(β).

Solving Trigonometric Equations:
Techniques to solve for angles given trigonometric equations.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions:
Understanding arcsin, arccos, and arctan and their properties.

Applications of Trigonometry:
Law of Sines and Law of Cosines: Useful for solving triangles, especially when you don't have a right angle.
Real-world applications such as navigation, architecture, physics, and engineering.

Trigonometric Form of Complex Numbers:
Representing complex numbers in the form 
r(cos(θ)+isin(θ)).
